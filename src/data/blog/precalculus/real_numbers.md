## Real Numbers $ (\mathbb{R}) $

Real numbers are the set of numbers that can be used to represent a continuous
quantity. Examples of these qualities can be temperature, length, the amount of
something (e.g the number of hairs on your head!).

The real number system has many different categorizations:

- **Natural Numbers $ (\mathbb{N}) $**

  **$ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... $**

  _All natural numbers are positive non-fractional integers, 0 is not included._
  _If 0 is included, then we would call it the set of [Whole Numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/whole-numbers/)._

- **Integers $ (\mathbb{Z}) $**

  **$ ..., -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... $**

  _Integers are any non-fractional natural number, the number 0, and the_
  _negation of any natural number._

- **Rational Numbers $ (\mathbb{Q}) $**

  $ \dfrac{m}{n} $ where _m, and n_ are integers, and $ n \neq 0 $.

  _Examples: $ \dfrac{1}{2} $, $ \dfrac{3}{2} $, $ \dfrac{4}{500} $_ \
  _Note that anything divided by $ 0 $ (e.g $ \dfrac{1}{0} $) is **undefined**_.

- **Irrational Numbers $ (\mathbb{R} $ \ $\mathbb{Q})$**

  $ \sqrt{2} $, $ \sqrt{5} $, $ \sqrt[3]{2} $

  _An irrational number, is a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of_
  _integers. Proving that an irrational number can be difficult and not always_
  _clear, so for the sake of brevity I recommend that you take a look at [this
  instructional video on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:irrational-numbers/x2f8bb11595b61c86:proofs-concerning-irrational-numbers/v/proof-that-square-root-of-2-is-irrational)._

  _Note that the linked video uses a [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction)._

All of the different categorizations described above make the totality of the
real number system. I urge you not to spend time memorizing them, instead
keeping note of them when you proceed with your learnings. Trust me, you will
learn them naturally over time.

## Properties of Real Numbers

Now that we understand what a "real number" is we can now spend some time
on the properties of real numbers.

- **Commutative Properties**

  $ a + b = b + a $

  _No matter what order we add real numbers, the summation will always be the same._

- **Associative Properties**

  $ ab = ba $

  _No matter what order we multiply real numbers, the product will always be the
  same._

- **Distributive Properties**

  $ a(b + c) = ab + ac $

  - _The sum of two numbers multiplied by the same constant ($ a $) will always be
    equal to the result of the sum of two numbers multiplied by a constant._

## Properties of Negatives

In total there are 6 properties.

1. $ (-1)a = -a $
2. $ -(-a) = a $
3. $ -a(b) = a(-b) = -(ab) $
4. $ (-a)(-b) = ab $
5. $ -(a + b) = -a - b $
6. $ -(a - b) = b - a $

Feel free to try out and test a few different numbers for $ a $ and $ b $ to see how
the properties of negatives work.
