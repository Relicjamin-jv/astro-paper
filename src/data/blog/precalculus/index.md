This dive into Pre-calculus follows the book ["Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus"](https://www.cengage.com/c/precalculus-7e-stewart-redlin-watson/9781305071759/).
Therefore it will follow almost verbatim the same structure the book takes us into
learning Pre-calculus. The goal of this is to organize and summarize each section
in a note like fashion, and with that, if applicable include some interactive examples
and further discussions.
